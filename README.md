## High level technical overview of this project:

* Build a board which is composed of a 3 x 3 square cells.
* There must be two players, "X" and "O". Player "X" always makes the first move.
* On mouse hover, in any of the empty cell/s their must be an indication of who the next player is (i.e. "X" or "O").
* On mouse click, in any of the empty cell/s there must be "X" and "O" sign marked depending on player's turn.
* On mouse hover, in any of the marked cell/s (i.e. "X" and "O") not allowed sign must be shown.
* Every element in the browser must be responsive.
* Define the winning combination as per the board.
* Define the draw combination as per the board.
* Show message to the players on win.
* Show message to the player when draw.
* Once the game result is decided (either X wins, O wins, or draw) no more moves allowed.
* There must be a restart button for players to restart the game depending on "Win" or "Draw".
* On restart, the game must function as per the above conditions.

## Retro

### What went well

* Requirements were laid out perfectly.
* Understanding of requirement and white board session was awesome.
* Mapping out the steps was done on day one to avoid distraction/s.
* Well articulated README file.

### What did not go well

* Lack of confidence in the beginning.
* Impatient when code does not go right.
* Fiddling with different options in google.

### Plans for upcoming project

* Stop fiddling around, need to stick with what was signed off.
* Regular interaction with TA's.
* Never say no attitude.
* No room for procrastination.
* Use JSFiddle to tidy code.
* Be patient and nice to yourself, as you are trying to run before you can walk.
